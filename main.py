"""
🐉 DRAGON'S LAIR RPG - Main Game Entry Point (v1.2.0)
=====================================================

🎯 WHAT THIS FILE DOES:
======================
This file is the "front door" to the game - like the ON button for your TV.
When you run this file, it:
1. Imports all the game modules (like loading all the game parts)
2. Creates a new Game object (starts the game engine)
3. Runs the game loop (keeps the game running)

📚 FOR NOVICE CODERS:
====================
Think of this file like the "main switch" for a house:
- You flip the main switch → The whole house gets power
- You run this file → The whole game starts working

This file is intentionally simple - it just starts the game.
All the complex logic is in other modules:
- core/game.py: Contains the main game logic (the "brain")
- config/constants.py: Contains all the game settings
- ui/start_screen.py: Contains the title screen
- world/world_area.py: Contains the world areas
- entities/: Contains all the game characters and objects

🚀 RESOURCE INITIALIZATION FLOW:
==============================
1. MODULE IMPORTS:
   - core.game.Game: Main game controller (the "brain" of the game)
   - config.constants.*: All game constants, colors, fonts, screen setup

2. PYGAME INITIALIZATION:
   - Pygame is initialized in config.constants
   - Screen is created with SCREEN_WIDTH x SCREEN_HEIGHT
   - Fonts are loaded (fallback to system fonts if needed)
   - Audio system is initialized

3. GAME STARTUP:
   - Game() constructor initializes all systems
   - StartScreen module creates animated dragon and UI
   - MusicSystem generates procedural chiptune music
   - WorldMap creates 3x3 world grid
   - ParticleSystem initializes visual effects

4. RESOURCE ALLOCATION:
   - Background: Dark blue (config.constants.BACKGROUND)
   - UI Colors: Hot pink borders, cyan text
   - Fonts: Large, medium, small, tiny sizes
   - Audio: Procedural chiptune music
   - Graphics: Procedurally generated (no external files)

5. MODULE DEPENDENCIES:
   - Game class coordinates all other modules
   - Each module handles its specific functionality
   - Clean separation of concerns

🎮 ENTRY POINT EXPLANATION:
==========================
- main() function creates Game instance and runs it
- Game.run() starts the main game loop
- All resource management handled by individual modules
- No external files required - everything is procedurally generated

🔧 DEBUGGING:
============
If enemies aren't spawning, check:
1. Are you in a town area? (enemies don't spawn in towns)
2. Are there already 3 enemies in the area?
3. Check the console for debug messages about spawning
4. Timer logic fixed: spawn_timer increments once per frame (not twice)
5. Look for "🐉 Enemy spawned!" and "🎨 Drawing enemy" messages

🎯 RECENT IMPROVEMENTS (v1.2.0):
================================
- Character-specific attack effects: Warrior holy slash, Mage fireball, Rogue throwing knives
- ESC/pause functionality properly modularized in game_events.py
- Attack animations enhanced with increased intensity
- All modules cross-referenced and synchronized
- Damage delay system: Enemy health decreases 0.5 seconds after attack animation starts
- Complete character drawing: All characters now have legs, arms, weapons, and detailed features

📁 FILE STRUCTURE REFERENCE:
==========================
This game is organized into modules (like chapters in a book):
- main.py: This file (the "ON" button)
- config/: Game settings and constants
- core/: Main game logic and brain
- world/: World map and areas
- entities/: Characters, enemies, items
- ui/: User interface and screens
- audio/: Music and sound system
- systems/: Special effects and particles
- utils/: Helper functions

🎮 GAME FEATURES:
================
- 3x3 world map with different area types (forest, desert, mountain, swamp, volcano, town)
- Turn-based combat system with three unique character classes:
  - 🛡️ Warrior (now a Paladin): Armored, noble, with a golden holy slash attack
  - 🔮 Mage: Robed, mystical, with a fireball projectile attack
  - 🗡️ Rogue (now an Assassin): Agile, stealthy, with a throwing knives attack
Each class has its own look and special attack animation, explained for beginners.
- Procedurally generated chiptune music
- Particle effects and visual effects
- Opening cutscene and story elements
- Boss battles and progression system
- ESC/pause functionality with proper state transitions

CONTROLS:
=========
- Arrow Keys/WASD: Movement in overworld
- Enter/Space: Confirm actions
- ESC: Menu navigation (overworld → game over, game over → start menu, character select → start menu, cutscene skip)
- M: Toggle world map view

    Main game entry point - this is where the game starts!
    
    🎯 WHAT THIS FUNCTION DOES:
    - Prints a startup message
    - Creates a new Game object (this starts the game engine)
    - Calls game.run() to start the main game loop
    
    📚 FOR NOVICE CODERS:
    This is like turning on a car - you just need to start it,
    and all the complex parts (engine, transmission, etc.) work together.
    
    Think of it like this:
    1. You turn the key → main() function runs
    2. The engine starts → Game() object is created
    3. The car drives → game.run() starts the game loop
